# guests / rooms == how many people inside 1 room.  if return > 3 it's not possible since max room size is 3

# if == 2 or less than 2 need to find any available rooms to fill these people

#1 Understand how many rooms there are available for 2 people
#2 Understand how many rooms there are available for 3 people
#3 calculate the amount of people // 2          -  add them people to the rooms for 2 people
#4 The calculation will yield number of requires rooms (X). check which 2 people rooms are the cheapers
#5 if leftovers people calcule the leftovers // 3           -  add them people to the rooms for 2 people
#6 The calculation will yield number of requires rooms (X). check which 2 people rooms are the cheapers
